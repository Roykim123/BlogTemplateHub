Update the existing React + Tailwind CSS project as follows, based on the previous Writely-style layout:

---

🔄 Brand Update:
- Replace all text that says “뤼튼” (Writely) with **“걱정마AI”**
- This applies to logo, placeholder text, page title, sidebar icon labels, etc.

---

📌 Redesign the First Page (`/`, the default landing screen):
- Split the main content area into 5 sections (grid layout)

  ⬅️ **Left 60% (2 vertical sections)**:
    - **Top Left**: A simple user message board (게시판), with recent threads
    - **Bottom Left**: A notice section (공지사항), showing site announcements or updates

  ➡️ **Right 40% (2 vertical sections)**:
    - **Top Right**: Embed a YouTube video (e.g., via iframe, use a placeholder link)
    - **Bottom Right**: Embed a premium video link section (use dummy link or placeholder)

🛠️ Tools Page Improvements:
- Currently the tool cards look like generic drivers/utilities
- Replace all icons or labels that feel generic with **text labels clearly indicating AI functionality**
- Example: 
  - “AI 요약기” instead of “완벽요약”
  - “GPT 글쓰기” instead of ambiguous symbols
- Use intuitive text so users know it’s AI-based

🔤 Typography:
- The current font looks outdated and too “gothic”
- Replace with a **trendy modern Korean web font**, such as:
  - `Pretendard`
  - `SUIT`
  - `Spoqa Han Sans Neo`
- Apply this font globally across all components
- Ensure spacing and weight are readable and modern

---

🎨 Style Consistency:
- Maintain white-based layout with only **Hermès orange** as the accent color
- Rounded corners, smooth hover animations
- Avoid techy or bulky UI, aim for soft, elegant Korean SaaS product feel

---

📱 Functionality & Routing:
- Sidebar menu still routes to: Chatbot, Tools, Rewards, Saved, etc.
- Make sure all sections are still full screen height
- Components are modular and responsive
- Optional: make chatbot on `/chatbot` page actually respond to input (use dummy data)
