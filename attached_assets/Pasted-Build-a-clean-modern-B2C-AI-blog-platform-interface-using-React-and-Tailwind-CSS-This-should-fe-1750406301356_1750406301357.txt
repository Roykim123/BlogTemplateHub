Build a clean, modern B2C AI blog platform interface using React and Tailwind CSS.

This should feel like a minimal, fast, well-designed startup product ‚Äî not bloated or corporate.

‚ú® General Design:
- Bright, white-based layout
- Very few colors; use **Herm√®s-style orange** only as an accent (for hover, active items, buttons)
- Use a small, soft Korean-style font like Pretendard
- Subtle shadows, smooth transitions, no hard borders
- Everything should feel compact and neat

üìê Layout Structure:

1. Top Navigation Bar (very slim):
- Height: **about 32px**
- Fixed at top, full width
- Left: simple logo (click to `/`)
- Right: notification icon, login button, **dark mode toggle**
- Background: white or light gray (use dark gray in dark mode)
- No underline or border below the logo

2. Left Sidebar (fixed width, vertical scrollable):
- Two-level hierarchy:
  - Use **visual indentation** and **font size difference** to show main vs. sub-menu
  - Do NOT use lines or borders to separate levels
  - Example:
    - Naver
      - Reviews
      - Info Posts
    - YouTube
      - A1
      - A2
    - Rankings
      - Top Visitors
  - Add üìò Tutorial as the last item
- Active sub-menu should use orange as highlight
- Background: white, minimal padding, compact layout

3. Right Content Area:
- Shows a grid of cards
- Each card includes:
  - Image thumbnail
  - Title + short description
  - Hover effect: slight lift + shadow
- No vertical scroll: content should fill the screen height
- Default route `/` shows a **notice board**
- Each menu item routes to a different content screen

üì± Responsiveness:
- Fully responsive layout (mobile-first approach)
- Sidebar collapses into hamburger menu on small screens
- Top bar stays visible and compact even on mobile

‚öôÔ∏è Functionality:
- React Router v6+ for routing
- Dark Mode toggle in the top bar
- Component-based structure
- (Optional) Use Unsplash for sample images
